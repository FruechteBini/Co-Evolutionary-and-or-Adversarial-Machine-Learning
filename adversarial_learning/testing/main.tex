\section{Concepts of Co-Evolutionary Testing}
\label{testing}
Learning systems are often used in safety critical domains, where potential failures can have catastrophic consequences. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate said architectures thoroughly to minimize risk and maximize safety. Due to their limitations, traditional random testing algorithms can not ensure minimum failure probability (see \ref{problem}). To address this issue, the following chapter focuses on concepts of co-evolutionary testing. Section \ref{avf} and \ref{coevolution} including their subsections will describe and assess two state of the art co-evolutionary evaluation methods.

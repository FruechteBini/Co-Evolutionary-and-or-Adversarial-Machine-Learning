\subsubsection{GANs}

\begin{comment}

    -look at gradient descent --> adjust weights in specific direction, move down the gradient
    - discriminator (classifier) (supervised learning) (0-1) fake or real?
        --> if discriminator says fake -> negative reward for generator
    - generator (random noise) -> generates new sample
    --> competetive game (one wants error rate to be high - one wants it to be low)

    - as the descriminator gets better, the generator has to get better aswell
